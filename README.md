`deepAI: Diving deep into the Ocean of Intelligent Solutions:

In Partial Fulfilment of the Course Requirements for CMSC 127 â€“ File Processing and Database Systems

The present system of the local university canteen is still manually done, where sales information is written and accessed manually by the users, vendors, and customers without using the latest technology. Moreover, the customers will also have queue and create conflict with other customers - not convenient.

With UPagCaon, students can enjoy a convenient and hassle-free experience when purchasing items from the university canteen. Our user-friendly web application enables easy browsing of the menu, quick ordering, and secure payment options. Moreover, the DBMS empowers canteen vendors with a comprehensive CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) system. Vendors can efficiently manage their inventory and make real-time updates, ensuring optimal inventory control and minimizing waste.

Utilizing Lucidchart to create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) which served as a database schema, PlanetScale to create the server which allows real-time updates and access to the DBMS, MYSQL to manage the database and server, Figma to create a prototype of the web application, ReactJS to build the interactive user interface and web application quickly and efficiently, and lastly, Github to compile all the files and codes used by the developers for easy collaboration.

Therefore, the group made a restaurant management system to satisfy the project proposal's goals: UPagCaon will serve as a core POS, inventory control, staff, menu, order and payment management, and a simple analytics. The following are the main objectives of the project:

- create a system where vendors can store products, view and update its details, and keep track with the orders.
- build a system where customers can create an order, view order summary and update it, and access their own order history.


Happy hacking!
